    I'm a flame, you're a fire
    I'm the dark in need of light
    When we touch, you inspire
    Feel it changin' me tonight
    Take me up, take me higher
    There's a world not far from here
    We can dance in desire
    Or we can burn in love tonight

    Our hearts are like firestones
    And when they strike, we feel the love
    Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
    And when they strike, we light up the world
    Our hearts are like firestones
    And when they strike, we feel the love
    Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
    And when they strike, we light up the world
    We light up the world

    We light up the world
    Whoa, oh
    World
    Whoa, oh

    I'm from X
    You're from Y
    Perfect strangers in the night
    Here we are, come together
    To the world we'll testify

    Our hearts are like firestones
    And when they strike, we feel the love
    Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
    And when they strike, we light up the world
    Our hearts are like firestones
    And when they strike, we feel the love
    Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
    And when they strike, we light up the world

    We light up the world
    We light up the world

    It never fades away, it's staying
    Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
    And all the greatest loves end in violence
    It's tearing up my voice, left in silence

    Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
    Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
    It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
    'Cause baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
    Reminding me, I got these scars, to forget your love
    Keep reminding me, ooh, to forget your love

    You left your burn (In my heart)
    You left your mark, reminding me to forget
    You left your burn (In my heart)
    You left your mark (Under my skin)
    You left your burn (In my heart)
    You left your mark, reminding me to forget
    You left your burn (In my heart)
    You left your mark (Under my skin)

    There's no room in war for feelings
    Hurt me to the core, still healing
    And I know you're no good for me
    So I tried to forget the memories

    Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
    Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
    It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
    Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget

    You left your burn (In my heart)
    You left your mark, reminding me to forget
    You left your burn (In my heart)
    You left your mark (Under my skin)

    Remember I told you
    To save it, it's over
    And I'll be alright
    So hurt me as much as you like
    I need you to let go
    I got these mementos
    And I'll be alright
    Yeah

    Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
    Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
    It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
    Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
    You left your burn (In my heart)
    You left your mark, reminding me to forget
    You left your burn (In my heart)

    You're saying it's hopeless, that I should hope less
    Heaven can help us, well maybe she might
    You say it's beyond us, what is beyond us?
    Let's see and decide
    We've been meteoric, even before this
    Burns half as long when it's twice as bright
    So if it's beyond us, then it's beyond us
    Let's see and decide

    And I will still be here, stargazing
    I'll still look up, look up
    Look up for love
    I will still be here, stargazing
    I'll still look up, look up
    Look up for love

    Don't you, give up, for me
    Don't fall, don't give up, for love
    Don't you, give up, for me
    Don't fall, don't give up, for love
    Don't you, give up, for me
    Don't fall, don't give up, for love
    Don't you, give up, for me
    Don't fall, don't give up, for love

    I'm trying to save us, you don't wanna save us
    You blame human nature, and say it's unkind
    Let's make up our own minds, we've got our whole lives
    Let's see and decide, decide

    And I will still be here, stargazing
    I'll still look up, look up
    Look up for love
    Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing
    Even when the night is over
    And I will still be here, stargazing
    I'll still look up, look up
    Look up for love
    Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing
    Even when the night is over

    That's how I find the light
    Don't you, give up, for me
    Don't fall, don't give up
    That's how I find the light
    Don't you, give up, for me (Ooh)
    Don't fall, don't give up, for love
    Don't you, give up, for me
    Don't fall, don't give up, for love
    Don't you, give up, for me

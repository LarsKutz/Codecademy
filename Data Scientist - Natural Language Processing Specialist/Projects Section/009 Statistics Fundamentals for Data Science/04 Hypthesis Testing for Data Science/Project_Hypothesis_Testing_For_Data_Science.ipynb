    "    - alternative: used alternative hypothesis\n",
    "    - pvalue: the p-value of the test\n",
    "- If you run the test correctly, you should get a p-value of `4.689471951449078e-05` which is equivalent to `0.0000469` (the e-5 at the end indicates scientific notation). This is less than 0.05, indicating that this sample likely comes from a population where more than 8% of people have fbs > 120 mg/dl."
